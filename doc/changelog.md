# Changelog

## [Next release]

### Added
- EggNOG5 root (tax 1) prediction

### Changed
- Package structure changed for higher modularity. This will require changes
  in downstream usages.
- Remove network weights from the repository, because files are too large for
  github and/or PyPI. `deepnog` automatically downloads these from
  [CUBE](https://cube.univie.ac.at) servers, and caches them locally.
- More robust inter-process communication in data loading

### Fixes
- Fix error on very short amino acid sequences
- Fix error on unrecognized symbols in sequences (stop codons etc.)
- Fix multiprocess data loading from gzipped files

### Maintenance
- Continuous integration on
  - Travis (Linux, MacOS)
  - AppVeyor (Windows)
- Codecov coverage reports
- LGTM code quality/security reports
- Documentation on readthedocs
