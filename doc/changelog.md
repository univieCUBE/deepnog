# Changelog

## [Next release]
...

### Changed in 1.2.3
- CI with Github Actions (Linux, macOS)


## [1.2.2] - 2020-12-10

### Added in 1.2.2
- Install from bioconda
- Support for 109 taxonomic levels in eggNOG 5 (was three before)
  (e.g. `deepnog infer -db eggnog5 -t 1239` for Firmicutes)
- Support for COG2020 (use `deepnog infer -db cog2020 -t 1`)

### Fixes/changes in 1.2.2
- Requirement PyYAML
- Test class imports
- Exit on requesting unavailable device (instead of raising an error) 

## [1.2.1] - 2020-08-28

### Added in 1.2.1
- Training custom models: Users can now train additional models for further
  tax. levels of eggNOG 5 or even different orthology databases
- TensorBoard status reports: Follow training/validation loss online
- Support for configuration file (``deepnog_config.yml``)
- Model quality assessment

### Changed in 1.2.1
- The command line invocation now uses two subcommands:
  * ``deepnog train`` for training new models, and
  * ``deepnog infer`` for general orthologous group assignment
    (and model quality assessment)

### Fixed in 1.2.1
- Fixed packaging issue in 1.2.0 (which was subsequently removed altogether)
- Several additional bug fixes and smaller changes


## [1.1.0] - 2020-02-28

### Added
- EggNOG5 root (tax 1) prediction

### Changed
- Package structure changed for higher modularity. This will require changes
  in downstream usages.
- Remove network weights from the repository, because files are too large for
  github and/or PyPI. `deepnog` automatically downloads these from
  [CUBE](https://cube.univie.ac.at) servers, and caches them locally.
- More robust inter-process communication in data loading

### Fixes
- Fix error on very short amino acid sequences
- Fix error on unrecognized symbols in sequences (stop codons etc.)
- Fix multiprocess data loading from gzipped files
- Fix type mismatch in deepencoding embedding layer (Windows only)

### Maintenance
- Continuous integration on
  - [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/univieCUBE/deepnog/) (Linux, MacOS)
  - [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/VarIr/deepnog) (Windows)
- [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/univieCUBE/deepnog/) coverage reports
- [LGTM](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/univieCUBE/deepnog) code quality/security reports
- Documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://deepnog.readthedocs.io)
- Upload to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/deepnog/), thus enabling
  `$ pip install deepnog`.


## [1.0.0] - 2019-10-18
