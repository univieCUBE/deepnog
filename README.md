# DeepNOG: protein orthologous groups assignment

Assign proteins to orthologous groups (eggNOG 5) on CPUs or GPUs with deep networks.
DeepNOG is much faster than alignment-based methods,
providing accuracy similar to HMMER.


## Installation guide

The easiest way to install DeepNOG is to obtain it from PyPI:
``` bash
pip install deepnog
```

Alternatively, you can clone or download bleeding edge versions
from GitHub and run
``` bash
pip install /path/to/DeepNOG
```

If you plan to extend DeepNOG as a developer, run
``` bash
pip install -e /path/to/DeepNOG
```

instead.

``deepnog`` can also be installed from bioconda like this:
``` bash
conda config --add channels pytorch
conda install pytorch deepnog
```

## Usage

Call the `deepnog` command line tool with a
protein sequence file in FASTA format.
Example usages: 

*  `deepnog infer proteins.faa`
    * Predicted groups of proteins in proteins.faa will be written to the console.
      By default, eggNOG5 bacteria level is used.
*  `deepnog infer proteins.faa --out prediction.csv`
    * Write into prediction.csv instead
*  `deepnog infer proteins.faa -db eggNOG5 -t 1236 -V 3 -c 0.99`
    * Predict EggNOG5 Gammaproteobacteria (tax 1236) groups
    * discard individual predictions below 99 % confidence
    * Show detailed progress report (-V 3)
*  `deepnog train train.fa val.fa train.csv val.csv -a deepnog -e 15 --shuffle
                 -r 123 -db eggNOG5 -t 3 -o /path/to/outdir`
    * Train a model for the (hypothetical) tax level 3 of eggNOG5 with a fixed
      random seed for reproducible results.


The individual models for OG predictions are not stored on GitHub or PyPI,
because they exceed file size limitations (up to 200M).
`deepnog` automatically downloads the models, and puts them into a
cache directory (default `~/deepnog_data/`). You can change this directory
by setting the `DEEPNOG_DATA` environment variable.

For help and advanced options, call `deepnog --help`,
and `deepnog infer --help` or `deepnog train --help` for specific options
for inference or training, respectively.
See also the [user & developer guide](doc/guide.pdf).

## File formats supported

Preferred: FASTA (raw, .gz, or .xz)

DeepNOG supports protein sequences stored in all file formats listed in
[https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO](https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO),
but is tested for the FASTA-file format
only.

## Databases currently supported

- eggNOG 5.0
  * taxonomic level 1 (root level)
  * taxonomic level 2 (bacteria level)
  * For >100 additional eggNOG 5.0 levels, consult the
  [docs](https://deepnog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/documentation/models.html).
- COG 2020
- (for additional databases/levels, please create an issue on Github,
   or train a model yourself---new in v1.2)

## Deep network architectures currently supported

* DeepNOG
* DeepFam (no precomputed model currently available)


## Required packages

``deepnog`` builds upon the following packages:
*  PyTorch
*  NumPy
*  pandas
*  scikit-learn
*  tensorboard
*  Biopython
*  PyYAML
*  tqdm
*  pytest (for tests only)

See also `requirements/*.txt` for platform-specific recommendations
(sometimes, specific versions might be required due to platform-specific
bugs in the deepnog requirements)
